# Power Outage Severity Classifier
## Introduction 
Modern society relies heavily on a constant supply of electricity to function and as such, power outages can be very socially and economically costly. Is there a way we can predict the severity of power outages in order to prepare better for them? This is the question I am trying to answer with this project. Purdue's Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure has provided a data set containing 1,534 major power outages from 2000 to 2016. This dataset contain a rich set of information about these outages, describing geographical location of the outages, regional climate information, land-use characteristics, electricity consumption patterns, and economic characteristics of the state the outages were in. Below are the columns that I use throughout my research:



| Column                    | Description                                                                                             |

| `CAUSE.CATEGORY`          | Category of event that caused the power outage.                                                         |
| `CAUSE.CATEGORY.DETAIL`   | Detailed description of the event that caused the power outage.                                         |

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Cleaning
I began cleaning the data by removing columns unneeded for my analysis. `OUTAGE.START.DATE` and `OUTAGE.START.TIME` contain string values and describe similar data. For easier processing, I merged these two columns into one column called `OUTAGE.START`, which gives the date and time the outage started. I also converted the data from strings to timestamps. `OUTAGE.RESTORATION.DATE` and `OUTAGE.RESTORATION` time follow a similar pattern and I merged the information in those columns to `OUTAGE.RESTORATION`. 

I additionally classified all power outages as `minor`, `average`, or `extreme`. All power outages with durations below the first quartile are classified as `minor`, all power outages with durations in the interquartile range are classified as `average`, and all power outages with durations above the third quartile are classified as `extreme`. 

I also added two other new columns, `PROP_STATE_SERVED` and `IS_NIGHT`. `PROP_STATE_SERVED` is the proportion of people in the state where the outage occured who are customers to the utility company correspoding to the outage. `IS_NIGHT` is a boolean column that is `True` if the outage occured during the "night", which I define as any time between 6:00 PM and 6:00 AM , and `False` otherwise. 

Below are the first few rows of my cleaned dataset with some of the modified columns mentioned above: 

|   YEAR | U.S._STATE   | OUTAGE.START        | OUTAGE.RESTORATION   |   OUTAGE.DURATION |   PROP_STATE_SERVED | IS_NIGHT   | SEVERITY   |
|-------:|:-------------|:--------------------|:---------------------|------------------:|--------------------:|:-----------|:-----------|
|   2011 | Minnesota    | 2011-07-01 17:00:00 | 2011-07-03 20:00:00  |              3060 |            0.485347 | False      | extreme    |
|   2014 | Minnesota    | 2014-05-11 18:38:00 | 2014-05-11 18:39:00  |                 1 |            0.483906 | True       | minor      |
|   2010 | Minnesota    | 2010-10-26 20:00:00 | 2010-10-28 22:00:00  |              3000 |            0.487093 | True       | extreme    |
|   2012 | Minnesota    | 2012-06-19 04:30:00 | 2012-06-20 23:00:00  |              2550 |            0.484498 | True       | average    |
|   2015 | Minnesota    | 2015-07-18 02:00:00 | 2015-07-19 07:00:00  |              1740 |            0.487018 | True       | average    |

### Univariate Analysis
Here is a graph showing the distribution of power outage durations in the dataset.

></iframe>
Notably, the distribution of power outage durations is heavily skewed to the right. Both the mean and median power outage duration are around 700-800 minutes, but there is a large right tail in the distribution. This shows that most regular power outages are relatively short, however occasionally very extreme power outages occur that last signifcantly longer. 

Here is a graph showing the number of power outages that occured in each climate region.

Notice that the number of power outages is not uniform between all climate regions. The most number of outages occur in the Northeast and the least occur in West North Central.

### Bivariate Analysis

On the x-axis of this scatter plot is the start date of all outages in the dataset and on the y-axis is outage duration.

></iframe>
We can see that a lot of short power outages occur through 2000 to 2016. However, there was no extremely long power outages in the early years. As the data gets closer to 2016, more and more extreme power outages occur with increasing severity.  

This graph shows the mean outage duration of each climate region.

></iframe>
Interestingly, this bar graph doesn't match up with the bar graph from the univariate analysis. The Northeast region experienced the most number of outages in the dataset by far, but the average duration of these outages are comparable to other regions. Meanwhile, the East North Central region experienced very few power outages, but these power outages have extremely high average durations. 


### Interesting Aggregates

Below is a pivot table that is grouped by `YEAR` and `CAUSE.CATEGORY`

| CAUSE.CATEGORY                |   2000.0 |    2001.0 |   2002.0 |   2003.0 |    2004.0 |   2005.0 |   2006.0 |   2007.0 |    2008.0 |   2009.0 |   2010.0 |   2011.0 |   2012.0 |   2013.0 |    2014.0 |   2015.0 |    2016.0 |

Interestingly, the mean outage duration of power outages caused by severe weather is decreasing over time, while the mean outage duration of power outages caused by system operability disruptions is increasing over time. This is better visualized in the line graph below.

## Assessment of Missingness 

Here are the five columns with the most number of missing values.

|                       |   0 |
|:----------------------|----:|
| CAUSE.CATEGORY.DETAIL | 471 |
| SEVERITY              |  58 |
| OUTAGE.RESTORATION    |  58 |
| POPDEN_UC             |  10 |
| CLIMATE.REGION        |   6 |

### NMAR Analysis
I believe that `CAUSE.CATEGORY.DETAIL` is NMAR. If the specific detailed cause of an outage is difficult to observe, then it is more likely to go unnoticed and reported as NaN. Therefore, the value of the data itself influences whether or not it is missing. This by defintion is NMAR. 
Additional data on how many people or which agencies performed the investigation to determine `CAUSE.CATEGORY.DETAIL` may change it from NMAR and MAR, as these columns may provide insight on the missingness of `CAUSE.CATEGORY.DETAIL`.

### Missingness Dependency

#### Missingness of Outage Duration depedent on Percent Land

Let us examine the missingness of Outage Duration conditional on Percent Land. 

**Null Hypothesis:** The mean `PCT_LAND` Land is the same when `OUTAGE.DURATION` is missing vs not missing.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** The mean `PCT_LAND` Land is different when `OUTAGE.DURATION` is missing vs not missing.

**Test Statistic:** Absolute difference in means.

**Significance Level:** 0.05

Here is the results of the permutation test: 
<iframe
  src="plotly_graphs/missingness-analysis-pct-land.html"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>
My observed absolute difference in means was 3.97. The p-value from this is 0.003. This is below my set significance value of 0.05. Therefore, I reject the null hypothesis. Missingness of `OUTAGE.DURATION` appears to depend on `PCT_LAND`. 


#### Missingness of Outage Duration depedent on State Population

Let us examine the missingness of Outage Duration conditional on State Population. 

**Null Hypothesis:** The mean `POPULATION` Land is the same when `OUTAGE.DURATION` is missing vs not missing.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** The mean `POPULATION` Land is different when `OUTAGE.DURATION` is missing vs not missing.

**Test Statistic:** Absolute difference in means.

**Significance Level:** 0.05

Here is the results of the permutation test: 

<iframe
  src="plotly_graphs/missingness-analysis-population.html"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>
My observed difference in means was 1,232,916.86. The p-value from this is 0.436. I fail to reject the null. Missingness of `OUTAGE.DURATION` does not appear to depend on `PCT_LAND`.

#### Imputation
The results of our permutation tests imply that missingness of `OUTAGE.DURATION` appears to depend on `PCT_LAND`. I imputed the missing values of `OUTAGE.DURATION` with conditional mean imputation based on `PCT_LAND`. I did this by categorizing all rows into a  quartile of `PCT_LAND`. I filled missing `OUTAGE.DURATION` values with the mean `OUTAGE.DURATION` of the `PCT_LAND` quartile.  

## Hypothesis Testing

I classified the power outages as either `minor`, `average`, or `extreme`. The outages themselves did not come innately labeled this way. Is there actually any underlying differences between these classes of power outages besides duration or are these class labels arbituary? Do shorter power outages happen in different locations or have different causes compared to longer power outages in general? I aim to discern this with my permutation test. I will be testing if the distribution of `U.S._STATE` is different between `extreme` power outages and `minor` power outages.

**Null Hypothesis:** The distribution of  `U.S._STATE` is the same between `minor` outages and `extreme` outages. Any differences are due to random chance. 

**Alternative Hypothesis:** The distribution of  `U.S._STATE` is different between `minor` outages and `extreme` outages.

**Test Statistic:** Total Variation Distance. 

**Significance Level:** 0.05

Below are the results of my permutation test.

<iframe
  src="plotly_graphs/hypothesis-testing.html"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>
My observed TVD was 184.5. The p-value from this is 0. I reject the null. 

## Framing a Prediction Problem

From our hypothesis test and exploratory data analysis, there appears to be some underlying differences in causes, location, and time for `minor`, `average`, or `extreme` power outages. Is it possible to predict if an outage is `minor`, `average`, or `extreme` from the other columns? If we can, then there must be some underlying differences between these outage categories. I will create an algorithm to do this. 

I aim to classify outages as either `minor`, `average`, or `extreme`. This is muliclass classification. The classes are not very unbalanced, so I will use accuracy as the primary metric to grade my model's perfomance, however, I will also look at F1 scores to supplement this.
